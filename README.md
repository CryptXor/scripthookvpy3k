# Script Hook V Py3k
This is an ASI plugin for Grand Theft Auto V that wraps around the C++ ScriptHook by Alexander Blade. It allows running scripts written in Python 3 in game by using the included [GTA module](/python/gta.py).

## Download
Coming soon.

## Building
If you want to build the ASI plugin yourself, you'll need Visual Studio 2013 and the [Script Hook V SDK](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/) which has to be extracted into [/sdk](/sdk) after downloading.

Install **Python 3 for AMD64/EM64T/x64**. Using the x86 version will not work!

Open the project file and build the solution in *Release* configuration.
